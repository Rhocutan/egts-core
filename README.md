# egts-core

EGTS deserializer is created in order to make working with the protocol more simpler.

## Get Started
    
    byte[] data = ...
    GlonassDataParser parser = new GlonassDataParser();
    GlonassData glonassData = parser.parse(data);    
    
## Notes

This is a **SANPSHOT** version so you can use it as is. If you found any bug I would be happy to have an issue report.
